# Example2_ggplot_Miami_plot
R script for producing the Miami plot from Timmins et al., 2020 (doi: 10.1038/s42003-020-01357-7).

A Miami plot displays results from a genome-wide association study.

The upper plot is for genetic associations with walking pace,
and the lower plot is for genetic associations with walking pace adjusted for BMI.

The R program Miami_plot_script.R reproduces the figure from the paper, stored in Miami_plot.pdf
